Solei is a medium sized mix breed puppy under 12wks old. He is expected to be in the 30-35lbs range although we are not sure on the breed mix so can't guarantee adult size or coat type. Moderate energy level, would love a friend in his new home but can be a single puppy as well. Loves everyone he meets.
