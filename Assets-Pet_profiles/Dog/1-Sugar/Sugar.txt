Meet Sugar
Sugar is a tripod! This sweet girl had a leg injury that required an amputation! This does slow her down in the slightest. She is sweet, loving, resilient and loving! Having three legs doesn’t slow her down. She loves to play fetch, go on long walks and make friends. She would do best in a home with children or a very active social family. She absolutely loves children! She most definitely is a premium co-sleeper. Loyal and faithful, this girl comes when called. She is house trained and crate trained. Whether hiking or cuddling you can count on her being present and happy, Sugar is looking for a home where she will be showered with lots of love and attention. She is good with other dogs and cats!

Sugar will be leaving Texas headed to the PNW soon and hopes to have her new family awaiting her arrival! Don’t wait to request and application, this girl will be in high demand!
