Meet Penny
PENNY! Sweet Penny is a chihuahua mix about 10 years old and 12 lbs.

Please read all about Penny (below) and if you feel you are a good match for her, complete an application found on our website and we will set up a time to meet her! www.mywayhomedogrescue.org

Penny is a snuggly and sweet girl who is looking for a person or family to love her. She is a mellow dog, good on leash, crate trained (although she is fine out of a crate when you are gone) and is good with other dogs and is fine with cats being around the house also. She needs to be encouraged to go outside to make sure she has no accidents.

Penny is an easy girl. Her perfect home will be a nice calm home with a person(s) who are looking for a companion to hang out with or to be there waiting when you come home. She is a great cuddler when you are reading a book, she will hang out in her dog bed when you are busy. Penny LOVES sleeping on her personâ€™s bed too! We are placing Penny in a home with children over 10.

Penny has had her vaccinations, heart wormed tested, has been spayed, de-wormed, had a dental, had flea treatment and is microchipped. Her adoption fee is $300 (our senior dog adoption fee).
My Way Home adopts in the Portland metro area only.
