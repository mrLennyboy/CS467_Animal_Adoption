Meet CASTLE
Hi there! My name is CASTLE. What’s yours? Nice to meet ya!

A nice person came along and took me in and, now, I am ready to hit the road to your house! Uh, make that “our” house, OK? I definitely need a house with a fenced-in yard cuz I need room to run and romp and be safe! The rescue requires (1) a fenced-in yard and (2) a vet reference on a current or previous doggie. The rescue wants to be sure my adopter does EVERYTHING medically needed for me to stay in good health.

I am a BORDER COLLIE/POINTER mix. I am 2.5 years old and I weigh 55 pounds. I have had all of my vaccines and have been neutered so I'm ready to go to my new home with YOU!! Those funny-looking 2-legged creatures said I’m also microchipped – whatever THAT is. At any rate, I am fully vetted. Is that anything close to petted? I love to be petted!
Wanna hear some more good stuff about me? OK, here goes. I do well with other dogs. I like ALL humans, too. I AM A PLAYING MACHINE AND A LOVE BUG MACHINE! I want so badly to be loved on as much as possible. I'm already potty-trained, too, with a doggie door. Smart, huh? But I KNOW I'll need more training to learn safety and all the things a doggie needs to know to be safe and happy and a good doggie citizen. I am fun and sweet and I also love to hug and cuddle with you.

I like to take naps when I'm tired from playing. I need love, exercise, and couch-sitting when we get tired! Let's be a team, OK?

If you would like to take me home (and you know you do), please email doggydarlings12@gmail.com and she can get me on my way to a new and loving home! My adoption fee is $450 and includes FLYING me to Seattle only (during COVID-19), a travel crate, health certificate, vaccines and a microchip.
