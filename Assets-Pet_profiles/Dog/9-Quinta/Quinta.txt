We place our puppies in families where someone is home much of the day and where any children are over the age of 5.

We answer all emails back within 48 hours. Please watch your spam folders as an application will be attached and this sometimes places it in there.

HIS/HER adoption fee is $550 USD and that will pay for TRANSPORT, all his/her shots up to date, neutered/spayed, microchip and rabies.

Please e-mail MuttsAndMeows@Mail.com for an adoption application.

This dog is currently in the Houston Texas area. Once the application is approved and adoption fee paid, transport will be arranged.

Because this adoption will be without meeting the dog first, we will need to try to be extra careful that everyone (including you) think this will be a good fit. We will try to give you as much information about the dog as we can. Unfortunately, many are fresh from the shelter and we don't know much about them yet.
