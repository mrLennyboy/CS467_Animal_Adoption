Meet Moose
My name is Moose and I am a year old Pit Bull and Rottweiler mix. Some describe me as lovable and playful but I am been shy and reserved here at the shelter. Once I warm up to you, I love to cuddle and give kisses! I am good with kids, I love cats, and I can be good with other calm dogs with slow introductions! I love going for car rides and being groomed! I am potty trained and crate trained but I would benefit from some continued training. With a little love, I will be your best friend!

*Please Note, If you have other dogs or children living in the home, you will need to bring them down to meet at the shelter before the adoption process continues.
