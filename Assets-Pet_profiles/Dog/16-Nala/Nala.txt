Meet Nala
Nala is a sweet little girl. Her owners had to rehome her because she went after the neighbors chickens so she will need to go to a home with no winged critters. Nala is very affectionate and loves to be with people. She needs some work on leash manners. After she was rescued she was fostered in a home with multiple cats and dogs. She needs to be introduced properly to new canines. Nala plays hard with other dogs. She would be great for a multi-dog home as long as the canine siblings like to play.
