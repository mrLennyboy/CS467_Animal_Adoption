LUCKYYY.

 

Number 7 just arrived to us from Texas and is settling into her foster home; she’ll be available for adoption after 1/18. So far we’re told this lucky one does great with other dogs and cats, sleeps nicely in her crate, and is overall a total love who’s eager for affection. Stay tuned for more information as we continue to get to know her and her needs better.
