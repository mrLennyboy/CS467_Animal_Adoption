He’ll Play His Best For You.

 

Little Drummer Boy arrived to us from California an urgent medical case with a broken pelvis and other issues of unknown severity. We got him up here and into our vet as quickly as we could only to learn that his broken pelvis had already begun to heal, and since it didn’t inhibit his ability to go to the bathroom or walk at least a little, all he’ll need is bed rest for the next 6 weeks. So Drummy will be available to adopt the week of January 18th, and till then he’ll be getting the best care in his foster home. So far this sweet, shy boy is a lover of all humans and just wants to be close to them and seems unbothered and friendly by other dogs, though he hasn’t been able to hang with any to avoid playing. We’ll be looking for a forever home where he can continue to take it easy and live his best life.
