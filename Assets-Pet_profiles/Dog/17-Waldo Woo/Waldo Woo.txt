Hi there! Meet the Dr. Seuss puppies!! These are a mix of this and that and everything in between. Our best guess is border collie and heeler probably! These puppies are very outgoing, and love to say hello to new friends! Marvin K. Mooney and Thidwick are a bit more laid back and go with the flow kinda guys. Waldo Woo and Utterly Sputter are ready to Rock N’ Roll! They need someone that will give them a job or keep them very active! We are slowly working on house-training. These sweet boys are about 5 months old and ready to turn your life upside right! One fish, two fish, red fish…nahhhhh no fish! Make it a happy puppy instead!!!! These pups are fun, fun, fun! Are you really ready for all the work in raising a puppy? Please research POSITIVE training techniques before applying to adopt. We care very much about your application answers and they are reviewed for completeness and the best match. Please fill out an application on the included link: https://threerivershs.org/adoption-app-2/

The adoption fee of $400 includes spay/neuter, current vaccines, microchip, free vet visit, 30 days of pet health insurance, puppy book, and engraved ID tag.
