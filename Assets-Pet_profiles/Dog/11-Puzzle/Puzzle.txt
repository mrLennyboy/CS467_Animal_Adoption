Female Cattle Dog / Heeler Mix

You’ll Fit Together Nicely.

 

Puzzle just arrived to us from Texas and is settling into her foster home; she’ll be available for adoption after 1/18. So far we’re told that she can be a bit shy initially, but once she’s warmed up has (and is!) lots of fun. Great with other dogs, nice manners, walks well on lead, and tries to “speak” to her person — this just may be the Puzzle piece that’s been missing. Stay tuned for more information as we continue to get to know her and her needs better.
