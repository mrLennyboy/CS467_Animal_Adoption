I came to Newberg Animal Shelter from a hoarding situation where the owner passed away and had 50 cats in the home. I am a shy cat that will need a quiet and patient home to help me come out of my shell.

If you are interested in meeting me, please email Newberg Animal Shelter at newberganimals@gmail.com with a completed  Adoption Application. We will contact applicants to schedule a meet and greet.

We focus on finding the best match for adoptable animals and are not first-come first-served.

With the current concerns about COVID-19, Newberg Animal Shelter will be adjusting procedures and protocols for the protection of customers and staff.

We are open for adoptions by appointment only.  This will allow staff to sanitize between each customer.

Due to limited staffing, limited appointments, and the high volume of applications we are receiving right now, we may not be able to schedule appointments for all applicants.

Please submit an application via email or fax including the names of all of the dogs you are interested in meeting.

Keep an eye on the website.  If the dogs you have applied for are no longer available, they have been adopted by another applicant.  If you see another dog you are interested in meeting, please submit a new application.

Thank you for your patience.
We are located at:
1591 S Sandoz Rd
Newberg, OR 97132

Some maps will route you to 1591 S Avalon Park, it is the same location.

If you have another dog in the home, we require you, your family members, and your existing dog(s) to come and meet the dog at the shelter.

The adoption fee includes spay/neuter, ID microchip, and current vaccinations. They have been wormed, de-flead, socialized and given lots of love.
