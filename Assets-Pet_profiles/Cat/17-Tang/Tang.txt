Meet Tang
Tang has impaired vision and cannot see very well. Because of this he is more skittish than his brother and sister and does not like to be held. He loves the resident dogs and grooms the foster dog. Tang needs a home with another older friendly cat or a home with a cat-friendly dog. He also needs respectful children in the home, older than 10.


Please head to our website to fill out an application prior to setting up a meet. Once your adoption application is approved we will contact you to set up a meeting. http://nwac-oregon.org/adoption-application/


The $140 adoption fee Includes spay/neuter, microchip, worming and flea treatment, current vaccines for their age, and a vet exam. Negative test for FIV and FeLV.

Northwest Animal Companions is an all-volunteer, non-profit foster-home based rescue. 100% of your adoption fee goes to provide for the medical and physical needs of the pets in our care.
