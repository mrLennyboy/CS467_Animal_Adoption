I am Sven, the handsome older gentleman with the big, baby-blue eyes! I’m a stunning 10-year-old guy that is a winning combination of big, sweet, mellow and adventurous! While I am perfectly happy to lounge most of the day, I do get quite active sometimes and very much enjoy exploring my space, climbing and chattering at whatever is going on outside the window.  I’m a very affectionate boy that is a little big for laps, but absolutely into being pet and snuggled up against you. I hope you’re open to a kitty in your bed, because I much prefer to cuddle up at night than to settle for a lonely cat bed. I love big, soft blankets and am an expert biscuit-maker, kneading and purring and making sweet eyes on you when I’m feeling extra happy. Like most Siamese kitties, I am very smart, inquisitive, and chatty when I want attention. My current foster mom has a small apartment and I have shown that I would much prefer a larger kingdom — though I’ve never been outside and am a perfectly happy indoor-only cat, I would do best with more space in a large apartment or house. I am not interested in sharing my kingdom with other animals, however I am a very gentle, polite and docile kitty that doesn’t mind lots of attention, being picked up or belly rubs, so a family with kids would be just fine. Pixie has already run blood work to ensure that I’m in good health and I had a dental recently done as well, so I’m ready to go home! Do you think I might be just perfect for you? I’d love to meet you soon — fill out an application today! I come to you fixed, vaccinated and micro-chipped for an adoption fee of $80.
