Meet Langston

The Basics: My name is Langston, and I'm a poet at heart?â€”reserved and shy, but very much interested in love. I'm very gentle, and once I trust you, I will purr and nuzzle my head into your hand. I can be extremely shy at first. I will start off hidden in a safe cave-like place, and you have to come to me.  Once I trust you though I am great company. I'm treat motivated and I don't shed much. I can be nippy but it's part of how I communicate what I want; I don't bite hard. I was a stray from the county shelter, so there isn't much known about my past; I am a man of mystery.

My heart is big, figuratively and literally: I have a mildly enlarged heart that causes a heart murmur. The veterinary cardiologist said I don't need medication at this time, but I should have a specialist recheck in December to see if it is better or worse. I have a nose that looks swollen compared to most cats, but it's not an issue and I had an x-ray to rule out any kind of sinus issue or growth. I also had some tiny teeth removed during a dental, and my other teeth are nice and clean now.

Likes: I really like to feel safe. I love chin and cheek scratches, and I might even drool a little if I am very happy. It's unclear how I feel about other cats. I loves snuggles, to be brushed, play, and I will chirp to communicate. My favorite prey is toy mice!

Dislikes: Small children and dogs would likely be too scary for me.

Looking for: A home that really knows how to help a shy, sensitive cat feel safe. I also need someone who is ready to take on a cat who may have a heart condition that needs medication or management in the future.

My estimated birth date is 5/1/2018.

*All cats at Animal Aid have been spayed/neutered, tested negative for FIV and Felv, microchipped, and are up to date on core vaccines.


Please note: due to our screening preference to view the potential home and interview the prospective guardian, we rarely adopt out of our local Portland metro area.
