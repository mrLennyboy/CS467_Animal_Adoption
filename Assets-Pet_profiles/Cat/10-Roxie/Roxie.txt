Meet Roxie

The Basics: Meow, I'm Roxie! I'm a deaf, declawed, senior calico looking for a new best friend. My person passed away and I went to live with family but I just didn't feel comfortable with the high energy dogs and other cat around. I'm a social gal. I like to be close to my foster parents and I adjusted to a new environment quickly. I'm also very curious about my surroundings and will explore every nook and cranny in a new home.

I need a dental and have one scheduled for February.

Likes: I like to be near my people. I love to be brushed (but please avoid my sensitive hips). I like to sleep in bed with people and sometimes on top of them. I love to chase bird toys and watch bird TV!


Dislikes: I would do best with no young kids, dogs, or other cats as I want to be queen!

Looking for: A quiet home where I will be the only cat with someone who understands my sometimes sensitive soul.


My estimated birth date is 11/01/2009.

*All cats at Animal Aid have been spayed/neutered, tested negative for FIV and Felv, microchipped, and are up to date on core vaccines.


Please note: due to our screening preference to view the potential home and interview the prospective guardian, we rarely adopt out of our local Portland metro area.
