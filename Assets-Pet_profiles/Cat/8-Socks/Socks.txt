Meet Socks
**HANDSOME - CURIOUS - TIMID**

Socks is a good-natured 3-year-old kitty with mesmerizing green eyes. He gets excited looking at birds and squirrels, so windows are special to him. In fact, his favorite toy is a stuffed birdie that he can toss and chase and retrieve! Though shy at first, Socks loves to be petted and get belly rubs once he trusts you. He shows appreciation with a soft purr and "biscuit-making".

Socks appreciates the joys and comforts of living with people, but he does find unfamiliar spaces a bit intimidating. He'll need your patience and love as you give him some time to settle into a new home. He will flourish as he learns that you are the source of yummy treats and trusts you to offer a safe, comfortable home where he can be loved.

Socks is FeLV-positive, which can impact his health. He will need to be the only cat in your home or live with other FeLV-positive cats. Please read our quick guide for more information: https://catadoptionteam.org/?jet_download=3615.

Socks is currently in foster care in King City. A contactless adoption pick-up will happen from the foster parent's residence.

His adoption fee is $15. To facilitate contactless adoptions, an $8 fee to cover the cost of a cardboard carrier is applied to all adoption fees. For more information on Cat Adoption Team's pricing and policies please go to catadoptionteam.org.
