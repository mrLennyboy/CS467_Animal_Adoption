Well hello, it's nice to meet you. I'm Lucy, and I'm looking for my new best friend. I have big beautiful eyes and soft fur. I was found as a stray by a nice lady, but due to a job loss from the pandemic, she had to move in with family who are allergic to cats. It took me some time to warm up to a new situation as I'm sensitive, but I am very sweet, too. I'm a round kitty and love to get pets near you or on your lap sometimes.

Likes: I'm not too much into play time, but I love gentle affection and want to be near you.

Dislikes: I would not enjoy living with small children and may scratch them. I also hate other cats and dogs. I want to be your one and only.

Looking for: A best friend who doesn't have any other animals.

My estimated birth date is 6/1/2017.



*All cats at Animal Aid have been spayed/neutered, tested negative for FIV and Felv, microchipped, and are up to date on core vaccines.


Please note: due to our screening preference to view the potential home and interview the prospective guardian, we rarely adopt out of our local Portland metro area.
