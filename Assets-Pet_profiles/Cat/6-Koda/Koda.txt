**Playful - Curious - Unique **

Koda is currently in foster and busy being adorable and sweet! Koda is FeLV positive, so he will need to be the only cat in your home or live with other FeLV-positive cats. Please read our quick guide for more information: https://catadoptionteam.org/?jet_download=3615.

Koda's adoption fee is $200. To facilitate contactless adoptions, an $8 fee to cover the cost of a cardboard carrier is applied to all adoption fees. This cat is currently in foster care in Sherwood.
