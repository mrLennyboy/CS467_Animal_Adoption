Meet Whaley
Whaley is a 10 year old, overweight, grey and white short haired female cat.

Here's her bio from her foster:

Hi! Life has been rough for me. For most of my life I was locked up and left alone because I didn't get along with the other pets. Then at the end of last year I was brought in to the vet to get put down. Luckily for me the doctor convinced them to surrender me, so I could have another chance at life in a new home!

I'm loving life at my foster's place. I love having the whole place to myself. I'm a love bug, adore being pet, and will let you know it! I also love catnip and playing. When I'm especially happy, I'll flop around and knead biscuits for you!

Please don't mind my bare legs and belly, I lost my fur there because of overgrooming I did when I was left alone and stressed. I'm so excited to find a forever home and family that I can call my own!
