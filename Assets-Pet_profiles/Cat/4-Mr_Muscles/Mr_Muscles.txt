Meet Mr. Muscles (purple collar)
I came to Newberg Animal Shelter from a hoarding situation where the owner passed away and had 50 cats in the home. I am a shy cat that will need a quiet and patient home to help me come out of my shell.

If you are interested in meeting me, please email Newberg Animal Shelter at newberganimals@gmail.com with a completed Adoption Application. We will contact applicants to schedule a meet and greet.We focus on finding the best match for adoptable animals and are not first-come first-served.

If you are interested in learning more about and meeting any adoptable pet, please come in to the shelter during our open adoption hours Wednesday - Saturday 11am to 6pm.

We are located at:
1591 S Sandoz Rd
Newberg, OR 97132

Some maps will route you to 1591 S Avalon Park, it is the same location.

If you have another dog in the home, we require you, your family members, and your existing dog(s) to come and meet the dog at the shelter.

The adoption fee includes spay/neuter, ID microchip, and current vaccinations. They have been wormed, de-flead, socialized and given lots of love.
