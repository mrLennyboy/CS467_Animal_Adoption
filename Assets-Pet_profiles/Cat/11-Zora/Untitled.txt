The Basics: Hi, I'm Zora! I'm a beautiful cat who is looking for a new best friend. I'm a sweet and social cat when I'm feeling confident. I can be talkative at times. I also have some boundaries and want to be the queen of your home. I'm smart, independent, and playful.

I'm a sensitive soul who is very loyal to my people. In my past home I did great for years until a baby came along. I started to have some inappropriate urination around the house and it was clear I just couldn't handle the sights, sounds, and smells of a young kid. I developed some crystals in my urine from the stress too. I'm on a prescription food to dissolve those crystals and since I've been in a room in the shelter on my own I've had no litterbox issues.

Likes: I love head scritches. I love to play when I feel comfortable. I love to scratch my scratching post and rub my cheeks on things.


Dislikes: I can not be around young kids, dogs, or other cats. I am in need of a permanent home with no other animals!

Looking for: A quiet home where I will be the only cat with someone who understands my sometimes sensitive soul.


My estimated birth date is 1/15/2014.

*All cats at Animal Aid have been spayed/neutered, tested negative for FIV and Felv, microchipped, and are up to date on core vaccines.


Please note: due to our screening preference to view the potential home and interview the prospective guardian, we rarely adopt out of our local Portland metro area.
