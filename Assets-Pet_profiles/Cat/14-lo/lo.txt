You can find out more about me and Animal Aid's adoption process at www.animalaidpdx.org.

The Basics: Mew, I'm Io! I'm one cool cat. I have a quiet meow and purr.  I'm a very curious cat who can be a bit shy. I'm a wary cat but once I'm comfortable with you I'm very loving. I'm sensitive to loud noises and in my past home I saw another cat out a window that scared me so bad I got upset at my people for days. When I am spooked my fight-or-flight instinct kicks in and it's fight for me. I am starting some medication to help with anxiety but 90% of the time I'm a very easy sweet cat. I like to be around my people and will hang out peacefully.

Likes: I love be pet softly. I enjoy rubbing my face on corners of furniture. I like small toys and a wand toy when I'm in the mood. I like bird watching and just checking out what is going on in the world from my safe perch.

Dislikes:I don't like other cats and I wouldn't like dogs either. I don't like to be picked up, but I will usually climb onto you and lay down if you are still.

Looking for: A quiet home where I will be the only cat with someone who understands my sometimes sensitive soul.


My estimated birth date is 5/1/2015.

*All cats at Animal Aid have been spayed/neutered, tested negative for FIV and Felv, microchipped, and are up to date on core vaccines.

Please note: due to our screening preference to view the potential home and interview the prospective guardian, we rarely adopt out of our local Portland metro area.
