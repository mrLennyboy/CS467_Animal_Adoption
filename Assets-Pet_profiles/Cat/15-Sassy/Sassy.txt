Meet Sassy
Sassy is a 3 month old, dilute torti kitten. She has soft short fur.

Sassy is very sweet and loves to cuddle on your lap while you read a book, work on the computer or watch tv. She's very playful and even fetches her favorite mouse toy. You can often hear her playing with her favorite toys with the little chirps she makes.

Sassy came into the rescue not really liking other cats and in the past 1.5 months she tolerates some of her foster siblings and even the puppy in the house. She would do better with an adult cat versus another kitten.

She is a very special girl and we are looking for her forever home.

If you want to be considered for adoption:
***Please email jessicanwac@gmail.com for an application and more information.***

The $140 adoption fee Includes spay/neuter, microchip, worming and flea treatment, current vaccines for their age, and a vet exam. Negative test for FIV and FeLV.

Northwest Animal Companions is an all-volunteer, non-profit foster-home based rescue. 100% of your adoption fee goes to provide for the medical and physical needs of the pets in our care.
