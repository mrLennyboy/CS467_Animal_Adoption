Meet Petunia
**Adventurous - Adorable - Shy**

Petunia is extremely playful, and loving. She is quiet and shy when not playing, so she will do well with someone who has the patience to coax her out of her shell. That way, she'll be comfortable enough to get brave and show off her curiosity and cuteness. A quieter home might be her ideal fit.

Petunia's adoption fee is $125.

To facilitate contactless adoptions, an $8 fee to cover the cost of a cardboard carrier is applied to all adoption fees. To apply to adopt this cat, use CAT's website: catadoptionteam.org/adopt. Primary Color: Brown Tabby Weight: 9lbs Age: 0yrs 8mths 4wks Animal has been Spayed
