Meet Gumball
Gumball is bonded with Milo and they must be adopted together. Gumball is a big 4 lb sweet guy, mostly. If you are a ferret he either loves you or does not care for you so much. He loves his human friends and will seek you out for attention and some quality playtime.

All the ferrets with WVFS have had a health check by our veterinarian, are chipped, current on their vaccinations and come with a free health check by one of our preferred veterinarians after adoption.

If you are interested in adoption from our organization, please visit our website www.willamettevalleyferretshelter.org.

Please note, our organization is operated with 100% volunteer time, our volunteers have commitments other than the rescue. We work to respond to all inquiries as soon as possible but there are sometimes delays.
