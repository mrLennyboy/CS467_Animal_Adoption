Meet Pan
Pan is an older guy. He is buddies with Zen and they must be adopted together. Pan is the leader of this pack. He likes a good adventure and meeting new people. He is always super excited to get out to play. He is a handsome fella.

Pan has been diagnosed with Adrenal disease and has been treated with a Deslorelin implant. He will require ongoing treatments. If you are interested in keeping ferrets as pets you should familiarize yourself with Adrenal disease as it is very common.

All the ferrets with WVFS have had a health check by our veterinarian, are chipped, current on their vaccinations and come with a free health check by one of our preferred veterinarians after adoption.

If you are interested in adoption from our organization, please visit our website www.willamettevalleyferretshelter.org.
