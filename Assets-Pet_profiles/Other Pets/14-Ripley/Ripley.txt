Meet Ripley
This gorgeous girl is Ripley and she is looking for a new home. She loves her heat lamp, her dark green, leafy vegetables, grated squash and cantaloupe. Ripley is approximately two feet long, including tail. Part of her tail is growing back after she "dropped" it in her former home. She is a low key girl, with a cute personality. Ripley has some sass to her that she will display when she doesn't like a new food or when something about her habitat is not to her liking. She recently went to the vet and had a good health check. She requires routine supplements to keep her bones health and avoid MBD. A proper habitat is required before finalizing her adoption. Her adoption fee is $75. Ripley is not used to routine handling or touch, so she will need an adopter who is willing to be patient with her and give her time.
*A picture of her setup and having prior knowledge on iguanas is required before adoption.
