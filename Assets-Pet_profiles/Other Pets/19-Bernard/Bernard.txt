Meet Bernard
Meet Bernard – Bernard was living under a desk, in a barn and eating things not appropriate for a pig when rescue arrived. He was nearly unresponsive and severely overweight, with limited ability to walk. He also went blind from the fat rolls permanently covering his eyes. Fast forward to one year later and Bernard is now at his target weight (though still with very limited vision)!

Bernard can be a grumpy elder who likes things on his terms and spends most of the day sleeping – though he loves a good sun beam in the yard on a beautiful day. His Caregiver says,

“I love how he snores so loud, you can almost hear him from outside the barn. He is patient while his face is cleaned and although he doesn’t make it obvious, I think he likes the warm washcloth face cleaning a lot – especially is he is out laying in the sun. It’s kind of a nice bonding thing to do.”
