Meet Milo
Milo is bonded with Gumball and they must be adopted together. Milo usually get's along with new ferret friends in his play group. Milo is a big 4 lb sweetie.

All the ferrets with WVFS have had a health check by our veterinarian, are chipped, current on their vaccinations and come with a free health check by one of our preferred veterinarians after adoption.

If you are interested in adoption from our organization, please visit our website www.willamettevalleyferretshelter.org.

Please note, our organization is operated with 100% volunteer time, our volunteers have commitments other than the rescue. We work to respond to all inquiries as soon as possible but there are sometimes delays.
