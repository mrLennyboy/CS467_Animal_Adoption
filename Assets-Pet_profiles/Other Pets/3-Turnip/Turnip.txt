Meet Turnip
Turnip is a lovely young lady who can often be found in her favorite spot: sitting in the window sill soaking in some sunlight whenever there's a break in the rain. Turnip loves to play with hay-filled items, like a sock or toilet paper tube, and anything made from willow branches. She really likes to explore and loves being underneath a table, a chair, or desk. She adores snacks and it's a sure way to win her heart.

Turnip's excellent litter box skills have earned her quite a bit of freedom. She is an indoor free-roamer in her foster provider's bunny-proofed home. Turnip doesn't bother with covered cords and she is okay with her foster provider's 20lb mixed breed dog. Turnip even likes to eat her salad next to her canine foster sibling every evening, and has tried to steal a nibble of his kibble. Like all rabbits, she will need a slow introduction to any dog or cat through short introductions/exposures over time with direct supervision.

When she was a baby, Turnip was found in a box with 11 other two-month-old bunnies outside a private animal sanctuary. Turnip has lived in a Rabbit Advocates foster home since she was rescued by the wonderful people who own the sanctuary. Born in the late Spring of 2020, Turnip is now nearly full-grown at around 5lbs. She is a bit shy in front of the camera, but she's a beautiful bunny whose eyeliner is always perfect. Can you spot the nose ring her foster provider photo-shopped into one of her pics? ;)
