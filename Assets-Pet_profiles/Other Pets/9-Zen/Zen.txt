Meet Zen
Zen is an older guy. He is buddies with Pan they must be adopted together. Zen is the chill guy of the bunch. He is excited to get out to play, but is patient and does not have to clamor over everyone because he knows when it is his turn. He likes to explore and play with all his buddies at play time, he enjoys meeting new ferrets and people.

Zen has been diagnosed with adrenal disease and has been treated with a Deslorelin Implant and will require ongoing treatment. Adrenal disease is common in ferrets. If you plan to keep ferrets as pets please research the common health condition that ferrets are susceptible to.

All the ferrets with WVFS have had a health check by our veterinarian, are chipped, current on their vaccinations and come with a free health check by one of our preferred veterinarians after adoption.

If you are interested in adoption from our organization, please visit our website www.willamettevalleyferretshelter.org.
