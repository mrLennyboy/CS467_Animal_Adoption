Meet Phoenix
Phoenix is a stunning lad who is looking for a flock of hens to protect. He is weary of humans and had an especially rough start to his life. He came to the sanctuary from a cruelty case and does let his guard down. He would be a great protector for a flock of hens, he is very alert and attentive. Be aware that he takes his duties seriously and would do best in a home that doesn't mind a rooster who sometimes will attacks people too.
