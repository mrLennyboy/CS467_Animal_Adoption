Meet Hulk
This handsome, gentle boy may be named Hulk, but he's small and sweet. He's also incredibly neat and tidy. One of the Marvel babies, Hulk's parents were rescued from a Portland park in June and he has grown up in the care of Rabbit Advocates.

Born on 6/6/20, Hulk is nearly full-grown at 3.5 lbs. He loves to chew on cardboard, race around, and rearrange his playpen. He is active in the morning, then takes an afternoon siesta, which refreshes him for an evening of fun and more play! Hulk loves a tiny bit of banana as a special treat. He also likes basil and lettuce, and is a good hay eater.

Hulk warms up when you sit quietly next to him. He is scared by fast and sudden movements, but fine when approached slowly and calmly by people he trusts. He would prefer a calm home without dogs, cats, or young children. With his excellent litter habits, he might make a great indoor free-roamer or husbun to a lonely lady bun.
