Meet Bean
Bean is a friendly lady who loves to explore and hang out with her hoomins. She is curious about everything and enjoys playing with toys. She has a soft, glossy, jet black coat and soulful eyes. Bean might be open to finding companionship with a husbun in a calm home.

With a name inspired by her foster provider's affinity for basketball great Kobe Bean Bryant, Bean the Bunny is also quite athletic when the spirit moves her! While she has not yet been a full indoor free-roamer, she could probably adapt to the free-roam life given her litter skills. Offer Bean her favorite greens, bok choy and romaine lettuce, and bunny-safe treats and she will be your best friend.

Born in late 2018, Bean is now fully-grown at 8.5lbs. Found hopping around a neighborhood, she is now loving the house rabbit lifestyle indoors. She does not seem to be a fan of cats or dogs. Bean tends to open up and show her sweet, affectionate side the most when she's in a quiet environment. She adores her foster family's respectful teenage children whom she has come to know and trust.
