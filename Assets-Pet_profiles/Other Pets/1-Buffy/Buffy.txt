Meet Buffy
Buffy the Veggie Slayer is a friendly lady who has embraced her mystical powers: she can make veggies disappear in an instant! She can also win over even the biggest grump with her endearing face and dewlap. She loves all bunny-safe veggies and she is highly motivated to get her paws on them. When she's not out slaying veggies, Buffy enjoys playing with her toys, especially her baby stacking cups with pellets hidden inside. She is also a slayer of delicious Bunny's Best Bites oat hay from Rabbit Advocates.

Found hopping around a Portland neighborhood, she is thought to be about two years old, fully-grown at 8.5 lbs, and a Palomino mix. Her foster family has a bunny-friendly dog, but Buffy isn't really a big fan of the dog. We do not know if she has been around cats. Her litter box skills are excellent and being a bigger bun, she would love to have plenty of freedom to run around indoors and explore.

She likes to be pet and doesn't mind being held, especially when her foster dad picks her up. Buffy adores her human brothers who are 'tweens. She always makes sure they're doing their school work. Being an inquisitive gal, she likes learning about all their projects and activities, and "helping" whenever she can. She has this way of looking at you that makes you feel like you can tell her all your deepest secrets and she'll understand.
