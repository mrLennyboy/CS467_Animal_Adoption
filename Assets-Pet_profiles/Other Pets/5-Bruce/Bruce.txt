Meet Bruce
Bruce is a sweet boy who wishes to find a family, and maybe even a lovely bun-wife, who will welcome him into their home. Bruce is still learning to trust humans and will need a patient furever home who would like to give him lots of bunny TLC. He likes cozy cat houses and fuzzy blankets where he can snuggle in and take a nap. Life on the streets was hard, but Bruce has been enjoying life indoors where he can watch the rain outside his window, instead of spending his days simply trying to stay dry.

He seems to be okay with kind, calm children and mellow, older pets. He especially adores his foster provider's young niece who dotes on him and sits on the floor and pets him for eons. His foster provider has a puppy and Bruce is wary of all that infamous puppy energy, so they're kept apart almost all the time.

Bruce was rescued in downtown Tigard in November of 2020 with three other adult bunnies and he is approximately 1 year old. He is fully-grown at 6-7lbs. Before he was rescued by Rabbit Advocates, he was hiding under cars to stay out of the rain and had black grease on his beautiful white coat. Thankfully, he is all cleaned up now and he's in excellent health. One of Bruce's favorite parts about being safe and warm at his foster home is all the yummy Bunny's Best Bites hay! His favorite veggie is celery, and an occasional tiny piece of apple.
