Meet Cassie
Hi! My name is Cassiopeia but my friends call me Cassie!

I was found as a stray and transferred to rescue to help me find my new home! I had to grow a bit larger first do I have been in foster care for several months.

I'm a young snake and I love being held and checking out new things! Being nocturnal, I spend most of the day sleeping in my hide but I do like to come out in the evening to socialize.

I'm also very healthy and I am a great eater! As a young and active ball python, I require my own habitat that is secure. I have managed to get out on a few occasions so my habitat will require a lock.

With the right diet, habitat, substrate, temperature, and humidity I can live a long and healthy life of up to 30 to 40 years! Though I am considered on the small side now, I can get as big as 5 feet, as a female, maybe even bigger!

If you think we may be a good match, or you would like to get to know me better, please click the Adoption Application button below my bio on the website - here is the link > https://www.smallbreedrescue.org/Home/AnimalDetails/169
