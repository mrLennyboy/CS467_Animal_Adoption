# Animal Adoption Web Application

This is a group Capstone Web App Project built for CS467 W2021. 

## Project Idea:

  * Dating App for Animal Adoption.
  * Match potential adopters with loving pets.
  * Adoption application submission and review.
  * Create, upload animal profiles.
  * News feed for new profiles and status updates.
  * Public and Admin user proiles with Google Auth.

## Motivation

  * Creating a responsive web application that will assist prospective adopters to find a suitable pet. Our goal is to go beyond the basic requirements and implement a web application that would easily facilitate animal adoption by creating a pleasant and simple user experience for both the public and admin users.
 
  * There are included several ‘stretch’ features, such as implementing the adoption application submission (public user) and review (admin) and a news feed for new profiles and status updates, with the goal to include them to create the full pet adoption cycle. However, we have indicated that they are stretch goals with the agreement that they are extra features and we may need to adjust depending on time constraints and may not be able to implement them all.
 
  * The focus will be focusing on the user interaction with the pet profile instead of additional user account functionality (ie. designating admins) so we will provide Gmail login information for an account designated as an admin. Otherwise, any other Google account will be able to login to see the public user experience.
